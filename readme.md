# secrdesignapp 1.2

secrdesignapp is a partial interactive interface to the R package [secrdesign](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=secrdesign). See the Help tab for details.

The main new feature in version 1.1 was support for systematic and random designs within a region of interest. Version 1.2 has many small improvements, including traffic lights and other warnings.

Click this link to run secrdesignapp 1.1 in your web browser from a University of Otago server:

[secrdesignapp](https://www.stats.otago.ac.nz/secrdesignapp)

Simulations may run faster on your own machine, and the GitHub version is always the latest (now secrdesignapp 1.2). To run in a local R session directly from GitHub:

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("secrdesignapp", "MurrayEfford")
```
Version 1.2 requires secr >= 3.2.0, openCR >= 1.3.4 and secrdesign >= 2.5.7. Also shinyjs and various other suggested R packages.

If you intend to use bookmarking on your local machine to store the state of `secrdesignapp` then specify the 'port' and 'destdir' arguments, e.g.,

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("secrdesignapp", "MurrayEfford", port = 8000, destdir = "d:/density secr 3.2/testing")
```
The URL generated by pressing the Bookmark button may then be entered into your browser once you have started a new session with the same 'port' and 'destdir'. This restores all input settings and the Summary table, but not results on the Simulation or Spacing pages. Bookmarking of ESRI shapefile inputs is not supported.
