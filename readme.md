# secrdesignapp 1.3

secrdesignapp is a partial interactive interface to the R package [secrdesign](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=secrdesign). See the Help tab for details.

The main new feature in version 1.1 was support for systematic and random designs within a region of interest. Version 1.2 has many small improvements, including traffic lights and other warnings. Version 1.3 has user control of traffic light thresholds and other minor improvements.

Click this link to run secrdesignapp 1.2 in your web browser from a University of Otago server:

[secrdesignapp](https://www.stats.otago.ac.nz/secrdesignapp)

Simulations may run faster on your own machine, and the GitHub version is always the latest (now secrdesignapp 1.3). There is also a limit to the number of concurrent users on the server. To run in a local R session directly from GitHub, first install R packages 'shiny' and 'shinyjs'; then paste and run this code at the R command prompt:

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("secrdesignapp", "MurrayEfford")
```
Version 1.3 requires secr >= 3.2.0, openCR >= 1.3.4 and secrdesign >= 2.5.7. Various other R packages may be needed for specific operations.

If you intend to use bookmarking on your local machine to store the state of `secrdesignapp` then specify the 'port' and 'destdir' arguments, e.g.,

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("secrdesignapp", "MurrayEfford", port = 8000, destdir = "d:/density secr 3.2/testing")
```
The URL generated by pressing the Bookmark button may then be entered into your browser once you have started a new session with the same 'port' and 'destdir'. This restores all input settings and the Summary table, but not results on the Simulation or Spacing pages.
